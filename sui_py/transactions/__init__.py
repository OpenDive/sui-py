"""
Transaction building system for Sui blockchain.

This module provides a comprehensive transaction building system with full BCS
integration, allowing developers to construct Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs)
in a type-safe, efficient manner.

Key Components:
- Transaction arguments (Pure, Object, Result)
- Transaction commands (MoveCall, Transfer, Publish, etc.)
- Programmable Transaction Block container
- TransactionBuilder with fluent API
